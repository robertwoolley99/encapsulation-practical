# encapsulation-practical

###Background

This is an exercise at Makers to understand Objects and Classes.  There are two elements here.

First, I created a single object to manage a secret diary, after having written appropriate tests.


Then I created three separate classes: Binder, Lock and Content.  I had to modify tests to work this, and understand how the different classes interact with each other.

Still a work in progress!
